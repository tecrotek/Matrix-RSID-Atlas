## ⚡ Zero-Friction Runtime

This is the repository for **Executable Cognitive Units (HCU)**.
We do not distribute code that requires compilation. We distribute **Logic** to be loaded into a Neural Network.

**HCU (Hybrid Chain Unit)** is an atomic algorithm (System Prompt) packaged in JSON. It transforms an LLM/agent (Gemini, Claude, GPT) into a highly specialized Senior+ level engineer. This is because "Seniority" is not defined by **Knowledge**, but by **Methodology**. While HCUs may vary significantly by *topic* (Research, Code, Biotech, etc.), they are identical in their *thought structure*. Each HCU compels the model to utilize the maximum of its potential within a specific, narrow domain.

## 🧠 Philosophy: Prompt-as-Software

We believe that the **System Prompt is the new Executable File**.
Traditional code (`.py`, `.js`) involves high friction: environment setup, dependencies, and compilation errors.
HCU operates differently:

*   **Zero Friction:** Operates via `Ctrl+C` -> `Ctrl+V`.
*   **Version Controlled:** Logic is versioned as strictly as traditional code.
*   **Model Agnostic:** Compatible with any SOTA model (Gemini, Claude, GPT).

## 🌐 GHN Topology (HCU Registry)

The repository is divided into 5 functional nodes. Select a tool based on the task type:

| 📂 Node Directory | Role | Use Case | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[`/CORTEX`](/HCU_Registry/CORTEX)** | **R&D / Logic** | Science, Deep Analysis, Paper-to-Code. | [`HCU-CTX-0001`](/HCU_Registry/CORTEX/HCU-CTX-0001_AxiomTranslator.json) |
| **[`/GRID`](/HCU_Registry/GRID)** | **Infrastructure** | API, Code, DevOps, JSON Parsing. | *Coming Soon* |
| **[`/NEXUS`](/HCU_Registry/NEXUS)** | **Velocity** | MVP, Marketing, Idea Generation. | *Coming Soon* |
| **[`/CORE`](/HCU_Registry/CORE)** | **Corporate** | Business Processes, Management. | *Coming Soon* |
| **[`/PRIME`](/HCU_Registry/PRIME)** | **Control** | Decision Making, Ethics, Strategy. | *Coming Soon* |

## 🚀 How to Use (Protocol)

1.  **Navigate:** Open the `/HCU_Registry` folder and select the required `.json` file.
2.  **Extract:** Copy the contents of the `"system_prompt_payload"` field.
3.  **Inject:** Paste this text into the LLM (at the start of the chat / in the System Prompt field / System instructions) or the agent.
4.  **Execute:** Provide the task (e.g., upload data, a PDF article, or describe a problem).
5.  **Profit:** Receive engineering-grade results.

## 🛡️ Security & Validation (VIS Protocol)

Every HCU in this repository has undergone a preliminary audit according to the **Matrix RSID VIS-HASE** standard:

1.  **No Hallucination:** Instructions include hallucination blockers (`Verify steps`).
2.  **Safety First:** Absence of injections and malicious vectors.
3.  **Physics-Verified:** Logic is verified against real-world tasks (Simulation Logs).

> *We do not publish "raw" System Prompts. We publish verified engineering solutions.*

---

## 🤝 Contribution

We accept Pull Requests, subject to strict requirements:
1.  **Format:** JSON only (must adhere to the structure of existing HCUs).
2.  **Validation:** You must attach a successful execution log.
3.  **No Fluff:** No "lyricism." Engineering instructions only.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Tools are provided "(AS IS)."

Created using the MTX-RSID-OS artificial intelligence system, based on modern LLM models, which may make errors; therefore, results should be double-checked.

The authors are not responsible for the results generated by the LLM. Always verify data/code before running experiments or deploying to production. In the context of AI, this is critical, as neural networks are probabilistic and may produce errors even with a perfect System Prompt.
